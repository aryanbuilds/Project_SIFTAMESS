"""Record the golden run: REAL ledgers + report bodies from real tools over committed fixtures.

Usage:  uv run python tests/golden/record.py --update

Produces (committed to git - the §2B "recorded-golden" regression floor):
  tests/golden/recorded_run/RUN-GOLDEN/   a complete, real run directory (ledgers + reports)
  tests/golden/bodies/                    the deterministic report BODIES (header-stripped)

The pipeline is real end-to-end (manifest -> readonly -> plan -> dispatch of the Epic-D
tools -> critique -> reports). One normalization is applied at record time: the absolute
evidence path inside ``evidence/readonly_mounts.json`` (the only absolute path a run
contains - verified) is rewritten to ``/EVIDENCE`` so the committed run is host-independent.

Re-recording refreshes ledger timestamps (real tools, real clock) - that is BY DESIGN; the
regression invariant is that rendering the COMMITTED run reproduces the COMMITTED bodies
byte-for-byte (tests/EPIC_M_TESTS/test_reports_golden.py). Re-record only after an
intentional schema/report change, then review the diff and commit both dirs together.
