"""Audited tool execution (D2) — the provenance keystone.

Every typed tool runs through :func:`run_tool`: it allocates a deterministic
``TOOL-NNN`` id, stamps UTC start/end, runs the producer, writes the structured
result under the run dir (path-policed), registers the derived artifact + a
``tool_invoked`` custody event, and appends exactly one fully-populated
``ToolResult`` line to ``audit/tool_calls.jsonl`` — on success AND on failure
(criterion 5: every call is traceable). No tool bypasses this.

A recoverable failure is logged as ``status=error`` and returned (the orchestrator
decides retry). A missing backend (:class:`BackendUnavailableError`) is logged then
re-raised — it fails closed rather than yielding a fake result.
