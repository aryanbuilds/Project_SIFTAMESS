"""Shared helpers for the parser tools (D5-D8).

Resolves an artifact-relative path to a real file *inside* a trusted tree (rejecting
traversal — case data is hostile, CLAUDE.md §6) and hashes the exact bytes the tool is
about to parse (a real per-access integrity hash that becomes the ``source_sha256``
provenance). Two trees are trusted: the read-only evidence root, and — for tools that
read DERIVED artifacts — the active run root (where ``extract_artifacts_from_image`` /
``decompress`` write ``evidence/extracted/…`` with run-root-relative paths).
